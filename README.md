# Today we talked about building a website for a grandparent. Here's some of the things you can try!

1. Build your own webserver using Sinatra-mine is there, but it would be good if you showed grandma you can make your own, too.

2. Create an endpoint that returns a standard greeting
    a. Can you make this greeting dynamic?
    b. What if no parameter is given? Can you make the greeting making sense? No `Hi, ,! Nice to meet you!`

3. Write a test for your greeting

4. Build a second page using TDD that returns some HTML. In this page, add an image of something your grandparent would like!

5. Add CSS to your second page.

6. Could you build a web server WITHOUT Sinatra?
